# plot_generator
 
This is a Flutter implementation of William Wallace Cook's Plotto. So far I have been able to do the Lead ups and Carry ons but Includes are turning out to be quite difficult as there is no set rule as to where to insert the text. The project is updated to support the desktop platforms and the web. I am working on sound null safety and have updated the dependencies.
Writers may find it useful to generate ideas.

# How to use
1. Click 'Generate'. This will generate a basic scenario.
2. Follow it up by clicking Lead-in or Carry-on to more deeply explore the idea.

# What's new in Version 2.0

In this release I have revamped ti UI as shown below:

There are arrows in every list item to fetch LeadIns or CarryOns and the FAB regenerates the skeleton.
